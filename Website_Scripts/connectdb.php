<!-- To create a web-based interface for the restaurant database, I will be using HTML, CSS, and PHP. I will also connect to the database using PDO (PHP Data Objects) to ensure that the application can work with any DBMS. Here is the step-by-step process to create the web-based interface:

1. Create a home page called "restaurant.php" that will serve as the landing page for the application. This page will contain links to the different functionality of the application.

2. Create a PHP script that will list all the orders made on a particular date. This script will prompt the user to enter a date and then retrieve the orders for that date from the database. The script will display the first and last name of the customer, the items ordered, the total amount of the order, the tip, and the name of the delivery person who delivered the order.

3. Create a PHP script that will allow the user to add a new customer to the database. This script will prompt the user to enter all the necessary customer information, including the email address, first name, last name, cell number, street address, city, and postal code. The script will check whether the customer already exists in the database and create a new account with a $5.00 credit if they do not.

4. Create a PHP script that will create a table that shows dates on which orders were placed along with the number of orders on that date. This script will retrieve the necessary information from the database and display it in a table format.

5. Create a PHP script that will allow the user to choose an employee and show their schedule for Monday to Friday. This script will retrieve all employees from the database and display them on the page. The user can then select an employee, and the script will retrieve their schedule for Monday to Friday and display it on the page.

6. Use proper HTML tags to format the content of the web pages, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables.

7. Add CSS to make the web pages visually appealing and professional-looking.

8. Use PDO to connect to the restaurant database and retrieve the necessary information.

9. Test the web-based interface to ensure that it works as expected.

Once the web-based interface is complete, users should be able to access all the functionality of the application through the "restaurant.php" home page. The application will be able to retrieve information from the restaurant database and display it in a user-friendly format, making it easy for restaurant staff to manage orders, customers, and employees. -->
